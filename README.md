# Challenge-3

## Description
This is a JavaScript based program that generates a random password based on user preferences. The program allows the user to choose the length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters) and which types of characters to include (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters). Once the user has made their selections, the program generates a password using the selected characters and the chosen length. The password is then displayed in a text box on the page.

## Installation
N/a

## Usage
When the user clicks the "Generate Password" button, they will be prompted to input the desired length of the password (between 8 and 128 characters). If the input is not a number or falls outside the range, the user will be alerted to enter a valid number.

The user will then be prompted to choose whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. If the user does not choose any characters, they will be alerted to try again.

After the user has made their choices, a password will be generated using the selected characters and the chosen length. The password will be displayed in the text box next to the "Generate Password" button.
